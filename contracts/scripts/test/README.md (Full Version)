# SolCipher Oracle: Cross-Chain Price Feed for Reactive Network

## Overview
Mirrors Chainlink price feeds (e.g., ETH/USD from Sepolia) to Reactive Network using reactive event subscriptions. Exposes `AggregatorV3Interface` for dApps.

Bounty: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/bounty/1305

## Quick Start
1. `npm install`
2. Deploy: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network kopli` (get testnet ETH from faucet: https://kopli-faucet.reactive.network)
3. Test: `npx hardhat test`
4. Usage: dApps call `latestRoundData()` on deployed contract.

## Reactive Integration
- Extend `updatePrice` with Reactive's `ISubscriptionManager` to auto-subscribe to origin events.
